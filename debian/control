Description: Utility for creating Java Debian packages
 This package provides the capability to build a Debian package from
 a Java binary distribution by running make-jpkg <java binary archive file>.
 (with archive files downloaded from providers listed below)
 .
 Supported java binary distributions currently include:
   * Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) :
     - The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 6, 7 and 8
     - The Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 6, 7 and 8
     - The Java API Javadoc, version 6, 7 and 8
 Choose tar.gz archives or self-extracting archives (_not_ RPM).
 .
 Please note that Debian recommends the use of openjdk-[78]-jdk and/or
 openjdk-[78]-jre, which are installed by default-jdk or default-jre for
 most architectures.
 .
 java-package will create non-free packages.
