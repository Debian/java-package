* To be done : 

(from java-pakage-0.42)
- remove use of dpkg --print-architecture from plugin alternatives installation in install/remove scripts.
- kinit, klist, and ktab not installed; handling of /etc/krb5.conf not addressed

(from Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com>)
- install into a multiarch location to allow installing the i386 client vm on amd64 and ia64. 

(else)
- make symbolic links for j2se/jre/bin/* in j2se/bin/ to avoid duplication
- make symbolic links for j2se/jre/man/man1/* in j2se/man/man1 to avoid duplication
- make symbolic links for j2se/jre/man/ja_JP.UTF-8 in j2se/man/ja to avoid duplication
